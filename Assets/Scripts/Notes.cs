    /*
    window -> sequencing -> timeline 
    is like a cinematic open game scene you can create it with it 
    And in animation window adjust positions in timeline


    En-capsule-ating - putting in a capsule
    you cannot communicate one class with other class


    it is very good to have your own prefabs of which you are using and it won't be linked

    when rigid body is on the object it will get all collisions inside the parent and in our case will explode enemy when hit


    Instances are prefabbed objects in scene


    In timeline we give information where to shoot where enemy is wulnerable and so on


    Singleton Pattern instantiation of one instance
    so with it we say that if there is at least one instance of Music Player 
    in our case then don't spawn second one, so it destroys it before it is created
    there is few ways to make Singleton Pattern

    for directional light position doesn't matter at all but need to move it with in scene globally not locally


    Post processing - adding effects for screen for environment and so on, motion blur and other effects thats cool

    also try to use Level design Beat chart what sections should be easier which should be harder and so on with that you can control fry
